    <h2>All Functions are Methods</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript all functions are object methods. If a function is not a
      method of a JavaScript object, it is a function of the global object
    </p>

    <h3>The JavaScript call() Method</h3>
    <p>
      he call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to
      invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
      With call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object.
    </p>
    <script>
      const person = {
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        },
      };
      const person1 = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
      };
      const person2 = {
        firstName: "Mary",
        lastName: "Doe",
      };
      person.fullName.call(person1);
    </script>

    <h3>The call() Method with Arguments</h3>
    <p>The call() method can accept arguments</p>
    <script>
      const personn = {
        fullName: function (city, country) {
          return (
            this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country
          );
        },
      };

      const person3 = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
      };
