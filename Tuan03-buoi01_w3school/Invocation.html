    <h1>Invocation</h1>
    <p>
      The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.
      The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked. It is
      common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".
      It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or
      "execute a function".
    </p>

    <p>
      What is this?: In an object method, this refers to the object. Alone, this
      refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global
      object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined. In an event,
      this refers to the element that received the event. Methods like call(),
      apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
