        Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.
        A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
        Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
    </p>
    <h4>The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:</h4>
    <p>
        objectName.property <br>
        or
        <br>
        objectName["property"]  <br>
        or
        <br>
        objectName[expression]
    </p>

    <h4>
        JavaScript for...in Loop
    </h4>
    <script>
        const person = {
            fname:" John",
            lname:" Doe",
            age: 25
        };

        for (let x in person) {
            txt += person[x];
        }
    </script>

    <h3>Adding New Properties</h3>
    <p>
        You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.
        Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties:
    </p>
    <script>
        person.nationality = "English";
    </script>


    <h3>Deleting Properties</h3>
    <script>
        const person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 50,
            eyeColor: "blue"
        };

        delete person.age;
        // or 
        delete person["age"];
    </script>
    <p>
        The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
        After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
        The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.
        The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application.
    </p>

    <h3>Nested Objects</h3>
    <script>
        myObj = {
            name:"John",
            age:30,
            cars: {
                car1:"Ford",
                car2:"BMW",
                car3:"Fiat"
            }
        }
        myObj.cars.car2;
        // or
        myObj.cars["car2"];
        // or
        myObj["cars"]["car2"];
        // or
        let p1 = "cars";
        let p2 = "car2";
        myObj[p1][p2];
    </script>


    <h3>Nested Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <script>
        const myObj = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
            cars: [
                {name:"Ford", models:["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"]},
                {name:"BMW", models:["320", "X3", "X5"]},
                {name:"Fiat", models:["500", "Panda"]}
            ]
        }
        // To access arrays inside arrays, use a for-in loop for each array:
        for (let i in myObj.cars) {
            x += "<h1>" + myObj.cars[i].name + "</h1>";
            for (let j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
                x += myObj.cars[i].models[j];
            }
        }
    </script>


    <h3>Property Attributes</h3>
    <p>
        All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.
        The value is one of the property's attributes.
        Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.
        These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)
        In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).
        ( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes)
